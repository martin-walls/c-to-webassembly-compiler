The project was entirely successful in completing all the original aims, and in completing an extension.
The compiler pipeline is able to transform C source code into correct WebAssembly binaries that can be executed through a JavaScript runtime environment.
Each of the pipeline stages maintains correctness as it transforms the code.
As well as the planned optimisations, such as tail-call optimisation, I was able to implement an additional extension optimisation, which significantly reduced the memory usage of programs.
