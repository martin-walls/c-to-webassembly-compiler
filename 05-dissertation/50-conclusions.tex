Likely short, may well refer back to the introduction. Reflection on lessons learned, anything I'd have done differently if starting again with what I know now.

First paragraph should reiterate what the project was about.

Summarise how my evaluation answered the questions this project was asking

Can briefly outline any ideas for further work

\section{Project Summary}

The project was a success; I met all my success criteria and an extension.
I completed an entire compiler pipeline that transforms a subset of the C language into a WebAssembly binary, and provided a Node.js runtime environment.
Additionally, I implemented several optimisations to the program in the middle and back ends of the compiler.

My compiler produced correct binaries that maintained the semantics of the source program.
My optimisations were successful in improving the performance of programs.

I gained experience using Rust, including learning idiomatic ways of structuring my code and how to work with the borrow checker to produce memory-safe code.

\section{Further Work}

I only implemented a small subset of the standard library.
If I were taking this project further, I would implement more of the standard library, for example all the string manipulation functions.
This would provide support for many more source programs.
Notably I would also implement \CInline{malloc()} and \CInline{free()}, to provide support for heap memory allocation.
