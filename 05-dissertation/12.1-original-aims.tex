This project aimed to implement a complete compiler pipeline, compiling a subset of the C language into WebAssembly.
This consists of a lexer and parser, using a custom abstract syntax tree; a custom three-address code intermediate representation; converting unstructured to structured control flow; and generating WebAssembly binary code.
Additionally, I aimed to extend the compiler with optimisations to improve the performance of the compiled code.
